# Reinforcement Learning for Job Shop Scheduling and Green Hydrogen Forecasting

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains my internship work on applying **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** for:

- ðŸ”§ Job Shop Scheduling (JSSP)
- ðŸ§© Flexible Job Shop Scheduling (FJSSP)
- ðŸŒ± Green Hydrogen Forecasting

The goal is to optimize scheduling and accurately forecast hydrogen output using intelligent learning agents.


## ðŸ§  Problem Statements

1. **Job Shop Scheduling** â€“ Reduce job completion time using RL.
2. **Flexible Job Shop Scheduling** â€“ Handle dynamic scheduling using DRL.
3. **Green Hydrogen Forecasting** â€“ Predict hydrogen output based on historical and environmental data using RL/DRL models.
